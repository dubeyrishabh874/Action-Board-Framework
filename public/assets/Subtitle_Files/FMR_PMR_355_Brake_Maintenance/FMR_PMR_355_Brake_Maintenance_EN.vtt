00:00:03.360 --> 00:00:07.520
Check the brake for unusual noise, heat or smell during normal operation.

00:00:08.240 --> 00:00:10.320
Make sure the elevator will not move.

00:00:11.040 --> 00:00:14.400
Remove the covers to get access to the brake and the brake drum.

00:00:15.440 --> 00:00:18.240
Check that the brake drum and linings are free of oil.

00:00:18.800 --> 00:00:25.840
In case of contamination, clear away any contamination on all functional parts of the brake and inform your service leader.

00:00:26.400 --> 00:00:34.000
If one of the brake lining becomes oily, means oil spread on the brake drum, replace both brake shoe assemblies with the linings.

00:00:34.320 --> 00:00:43.040
If there is a risk of further oil contamination, install an oil wiper and schedule regular visits to monitor the situation until the root cause has been rectified.

00:00:43.520 --> 00:00:47.200
Units with contaminated brake parts must never be left in operation.

00:00:47.760 --> 00:00:55.760
Check the wear of the brake lining and its fixation If any part of the lining is separated from the brake shoe, replace the whole brake shoe assembly with the lining.

00:00:56.080 --> 00:01:00.080
The brake lining thickness must be 4mm or more Replace if it's below.

00:01:00.800 --> 00:01:06.240
Check the support angle touches the brake shoe when the brake is closed If necessary, adjust the support angle.

00:01:06.720 --> 00:01:11.760
A correct setting will ensure a correct air gap between the brake lining and the drum during operation.

00:01:12.320 --> 00:01:17.200
Check that all linkages, springs and nuts are secured and free from rust.

00:01:18.880 --> 00:01:23.040
Remove the rubber O-ring carefully Sharp objects must not be used.

00:01:23.920 --> 00:01:33.120
Measure the dimensions at the different air gap points on the brake magnet 1.2mm on the top, 1.1mm in the middle and 1mm at the bottom.

00:01:33.840 --> 00:01:41.200
Indications for incorrect air gaps is loud noise when the brake is applied Adjust if necessary and confirm correct operation.

00:01:41.760 --> 00:01:49.040
Check the O-ring and replace if it's not in good condition anymore The O-ring minimizes noise and prevent ingress of materials.

00:01:49.680 --> 00:01:57.720
Depends on the production year a sealed sealing cap should be present Units with a bushing must have a sealed sealing cap with the brake closed.

00:01:58.080 --> 00:02:04.320
Check that the KB actuating bracket just touched the contact plunger Adjust if necessary and check the correct function.

00:02:04.880 --> 00:02:10.160
It's important that both contacts switch at the same time This can be checked with the help of a feeder gauge.

00:02:10.720 --> 00:02:18.160
In case of KB adjustments, always perform several trips and check that both KB switch and no brake errors are reported in the error lock.

00:02:18.960 --> 00:02:23.120
In case of any errors, check the details and repeat the KB adjustments.
