00:00:00.960 --> 00:00:06.400
If the brake is found to be contaminated with oil, proceed according to the instructions in the following video.

00:00:06.960 --> 00:00:11.520
Please note that this video is a general process and is not component specific.

00:00:12.560 --> 00:00:23.440
If oil or grease was identified on the brake drum, brake shoes and in the rear nearby, position the car on top landing and lower the counterweight fully on the counterweight buffers.

00:00:24.560 --> 00:00:29.920
Inform your service leader that oil contamination has been identified and should be considered high risk.

00:00:31.360 --> 00:00:38.880
Remove all remaining machine covers and prepare to inspect and clean the entire area Arrange brake shoes for replacement.

00:00:39.120 --> 00:00:45.520
Clean the machine and all surrounding areas with lint free cloths and VOC free non oil based cleaner.

00:00:45.840 --> 00:00:52.960
Check the grease quality at the outlet pipes and grease collectors Hard grease will require the outlet pipes to be cleaned.

00:00:53.680 --> 00:00:56.800
Remove the collectors and if possible the outlet pipes.

00:00:57.680 --> 00:01:03.520
Clean all outlet pipes as good as possible and make sure that they are not blocked by old and hard grease.

00:01:04.400 --> 00:01:09.280
Before putting back the outlet pipe, check the outlet itself and remove hard grease.

00:01:10.080 --> 00:01:18.320
Reinstall the outlet pipe, clean the grease box and put it back Perform the same work on all other outlet and outlet pipes.

00:01:18.800 --> 00:01:27.520
If an automatic lubrication system is fitted to the machine, ensure the functionality and grease pipe connections are according field information 903.

00:01:28.160 --> 00:01:32.720
The ALS should be switched off until the grease leakage has been identified and fixed.

00:01:33.360 --> 00:01:41.120
Move the car up and take it off the buffers Pay attention to the brake performance after releasing the direction button The elevator should stop immediately.

00:01:41.760 --> 00:01:48.080
After the breakthrough replacement, conduct a brake capacity test and also a brake performance test Empty car up.

00:01:48.560 --> 00:01:53.200
Both these tests must be successful before the elevator could be put back into operation.

00:01:53.840 --> 00:02:00.240
The brake capacity test might not be available on all the units Please contact your supervisor if you are not sure.

00:02:01.040 --> 00:02:06.160
After the brake performance test, most of the controllers will provide you a deceleration rate.

00:02:07.200 --> 00:02:14.000
Depends to the controller generation This information will be shown straight after the test or be stored in the controller sub menu.

00:02:14.480 --> 00:02:22.800
For later reference, record the new values in the control cabinet or logbook For gearless machines and deceleration rates available, use the following table.

00:02:25.440 --> 00:02:30.320
For gearless machines without deceleration rate available, the following table can be used.

00:02:33.360 --> 00:02:39.200
More test variants and further information can be found in J42500101.
